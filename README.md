shnort - VS Code Notebook handler for Simple Html Notes with the Observable RunTime
================================================================================

The [Observable Runtime][] is a JavaScript library that powers
[Observable Notes][].  Observable Notebooks however aren't authored
in JavaScript, but in a [JS-like language] (compiled to JS, using the Observable
Runtime as it's core library).

This is an experiment to see if the runtime can be made "easier" to use in
JavaScript itself.  Using the [VS Code Notebook API][] as the user interface.

We'll see!
